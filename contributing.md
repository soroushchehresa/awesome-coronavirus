# Contribution Guidelines

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- **If you want to contribute, note that you should only update `data/*.json`.**
- Place your item at end of the related list.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome, but should be done in a separate pull request.


Thanks in advance for your suggestion 🙏
