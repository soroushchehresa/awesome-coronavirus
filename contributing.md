# Contribution Guidelines

If you want to contribute, note that you should only update `data/*.json`.

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome, but should be done in a separate pull request.

Thank you for your suggestion!
